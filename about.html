<h3>Our Convention</h3>

<p>ArmadilloCon is an annual literary convention sponsored by the Fandom Association of Central Texas, Inc.. The primary focus of ArmadilloCon is science fiction and fantasy, but we also pay attention to art, animation, science, media, and gaming. Every year, dozens of professional writers, artists and editors attend the convention. We invite you to attend the convention, especially if you are a fan of reading, writing, gaming, and generally having fun.</p>

<h3>Our Attendees</h3>

<p>ArmadilloCon attracts around 450 people each year. The attendees are a mixed bunch, ranging from pre-teens to senior citizens. Income and education levels for ArmadilloCon attendees vary widely. The common denominator is a love for the written word, especially fantasy and science fiction.</p>
