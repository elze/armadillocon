     <h2>Friendly Fun Gaming!</h2>      

<p>ArmadilloCon 37 will feature two rooms of board, card and role playing games. As always, we will provide many games to play. Some take a few minutes. Others can take a few hours. New players are always welcomed. We will teach you how to play. </p>

<h3>Gamemasters Wanted!</h3>

<p>If you are a game or dungeon master, we can make space for you to run a scenario at the ArmadilloCon.  Please <a href="http://2015.armadillocon.org/contact">contact ArmadilloCon 37 Gaming</a> to start the conversation.</p>

<h3>New and Featured - Artemis!</h3>

<p>New to ArmadilloCon this year will be the live-action spaceship bridge combat simulator <a href="http://www.artemis.eochu.com/">Artemis</a>.</p>

<p>Artemis uses a small network of computers to provide stations for Communications, Helms, Engineering, Science and Weapons officers. On the main screen is the external viewfinder. The captain does not have a station. He or she sits in the command chair and is responsible for calling the shots. (Artemis may seem very familiar to fans of Star Trek.) Rev3Games <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9Q2X32hZNk&index=74&list=PL532DC01F548EE15C">reviewed Artemis</a> in 2012.</p>

<p>Artemis sessions are scheduled. Visit <a href="http://www.timecenter.com/ac37">www.timecenter.com/ac37</a> to register your seat or stop by Room 104. Gaming will be available as 20 minute intro sessions, 20 minute short sessions, 50 minute veteran sessions, and 90+ minute ultimate battles.

<p>The Artemis project is looking for computers to fill out our bridge. If you would like to loan your system, or if you would like to assist in the pre-con play tests and lighting project, please contact ArmadilloCon 37 Gaming.</p>
