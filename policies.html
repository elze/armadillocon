     <h2>Convention Policies</h2>      
<h3>Badge</h3>
<p>Your badge is the property of the Fandom Association of Central Texas, Inc., the sponsors of ArmadilloCon. It may be repossessed at any time, so be good. You must be wearing your badge to participate in all ArmadilloCon events. If you lose your badge, please notify the Registration Desk. There is a replacement fee of $5 per lost badge.</p>

<h3>Harassment Policy</h3>

<p>We at ArmadilloCon are committed to providing a convention experience that is fun for everyone involved. ArmadilloCon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free convention for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of convention participants in any form. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. </p>

<p>If you believe that you are being harassed by another person at ArmadilloCon, we recommend that you tell the person in a clear and unambiguous manner that their conduct is unwelcome and that you want it to stop. If the conduct does not cease after you have warned the offending person to stop, you should visit the Registration Desk and ask to speak to either of the Chairs.</p>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. We reserve the right to revoke the membership, with no refund, of anyone who breaks this rule.</p>

<h3>Refund Policy</h3>

<p>No refunds will be given after pre-registration has closed. This includes, but is not limited to, fees for registration, advertisements, and Dealers' Room tables.</p>

<h3>Weapons Policy</h3>

<p>Weapons are strictly prohibited at ArmadilloCon. Weapons purchased in the Dealers' Room must be secured in public spaces. Failure to comply with this rule will result in the immediate revocation of your membership, with no refund. </p>
