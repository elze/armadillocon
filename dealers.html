<h2>Dealers</h2>      

<h3>General Information</h3>

<p>Tables are standard 6-foot banquet tables, with covers. Table cost is $100. Dealers must provide their own merchandise covers; none will be provided. The first two tables you book come with one free convention membership. Additional memberships may be purchased for $25 each, with a maximum of 3 total memberships per dealer. Electricity and wireless must be requested in advance.  Wireless may require an additional fee.</p>

<p>Please note that the dealers' room is semi-juried. While we are open to all dealers, we try to maintain a balance of types of dealers to ensure that both our attendees and the attending dealers have a good convention. Thus, before sending payment, make sure to contact the Dealers' Room Coordinator.<p>
